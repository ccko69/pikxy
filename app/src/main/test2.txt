analyze the project PIKX+res_v2.
create a new directory in "app/src/main/java/com/ccko/pikxplus/ui/imgviewer".
rewrite the file "ViewerFragment.java" in a more efficient way and divide it to separate, smaller classes.
place the new classes in "app/src/main/java/com/ccko/pikxplus/ui/imgviewer".

write a summary of all potentially glitches or problems in app/src/main/test2.txt. 
and after that write a summary of what you changed.


git remote add origin https://github.com/ccko69/pikxy.git
git branch -M main
git branch -M main




Step 2: Connect Your Local Project to GitHub

First, ensure your local folder is a Git repository and linked to the correct remote on GitHub.

Initialize Git and Link to Remote

1. Navigate to your project folder in the terminal: cd /path/to/your/project.
2. Initialize a Git repository: git init -b main.
3. Stage all files: git add . (or git add filename for specific files).
4. Make your first commit: git commit -m "Initial commit".
5. Link to GitHub: If you are adding a new remote, use:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
   ```
   If you are changing an existing regit init -b mainmote URL (e.g., switching from HTTPS to SSH), use:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
   ```
   The command git remote -v will show your current remote URL.

🚀 Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

Now, push your committed code to the remote repository.

· The basic command is git push -u origin main.
· -u sets "origin main" as the default upstream branch, so you can use just git push next time.
· If your default branch is named master, use that name instead of main.
